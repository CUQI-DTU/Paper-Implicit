Here we collect some experimental codes/notebooks to explore the use of regularized/implicit priors.

## Reminders

- You might want to try the latest development of `RegularizedLinearRTO` from Jasper's fork. If that's the case, here are some relevant codes for your convenience:
```python
git clone git@github.com:jeverink/CUQIpy.git
cd CUQIpy
git checkout regularizedGaussian-extension
pip install ./
```
